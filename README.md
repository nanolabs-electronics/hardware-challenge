Interview Hardware Test files

Prerequisites:
- Eagle CAD installed (Windows/Linux)
- Fusion 360 installed (Windows) - optional

The purpose of this test is to check both basic and advanced design actions in Eagle CAD.  
Down below you will find a list of primary and secondary goals. The completion of primary goals will allow you to enter the interview.   
Solving secondary goals will be translated to bonus points.  

One can solve any task, in any desired order. We recommend to solve it on your own, with minimal external help (Internet resources can be used).
There is no time limit for solving the challenge, but a timely delivery is appreciated.  
Any fraudulent attempt will be discovered in the technical interview.  

May the odds be ever in your favour! :]
